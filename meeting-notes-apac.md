## How This Meeting Works

This GitHub Readme is open for edit. We encourage suggestions for upcoming meeting topics. If there are none 24 hours before the meeting, we may propose canceling on our Slack channel and mailing list.

Action Items recorded in the meeting will be turned into GitHub issues and assigned to the [TAG project board](https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/10). The meeting is recorded and posted to our YouTube Playlist before the end of the week. A host moderates the meeting, and we encourage hand-raising instead of interrupting.

We adhere to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
